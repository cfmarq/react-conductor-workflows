## About the react-conductor-workflows v0.1.5

First of all, this is the result of customizing something existing according to my needs.

This React plugin is based on:
 **[MrBlenny](https://github.com/MrBlenny)**  **[react-flow-chart](<https://github.com/MrBlenny/react-flow-chart>)**
 and
 **[Fengzhen8023](https://github.com/Fengzhen8023)**  **[react-flow-chart](<https://github.com/Fengzhen8023/react-workflowt>)**

## Install

```shell
npm install react-conductor-workflows@0.1.5
```
